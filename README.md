# CONT
a project that I was working on that I dropped.

## what is(was) this
a project that was mainly to improve my rust skills. <br>
it was a replacement for the linux 'cat' command which was intended to have a lot of features including

- copying files
- printing file to the screen in a pretty way with syntax highlighting
- moving and renaming files
- showing file info and changing file permissions
- a really nice terminal gui for viewing files

## why it was dropped
I found a tool that was doing the exact same stuff I was implementing which was named 'bat'
so I basically gave up on the project but I decided to release it anyway on github


### what it looks like


### important
the current code of the project is not complete and everything bad with it was going to be fixed but yolo

### bright side
I learned a lot of shit

### bat
[here](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) is the link for bat if you're interested.
